# NLP-Comparison-table-of-commonly-used-acronyms-for-developers
### It is a excel file that contains commonly used acronyms and corresponding full names in developing communications(English).

I'm working on an NLP related project with LIWC recently. I need to process some comments in the development process of programmers. There are so many acronyms that are not contained in LIWC dic. So I need to replace them with the full name. I've compiled a list of acronyms based on web search results and my own projects.

#### It contains 81 rows and two columns like this:  
- acronyms
- full name
